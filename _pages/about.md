I'm Bryan Woolsey. If you want to find me on the internet, I typically go by the handle "RagnarKon" (or some variation thereof).

I'm a technology engineer working within the IT organization for a Fortune 500 company. More specifically, I help manage the various configuration management toolsets in use at the
organization. One such toolset is [Puppet](https://puppet.com), which I spent most of my time working on and talking about.
